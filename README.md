# Welcome to IdeaBox!

This is a project that every developer has built, and so here is the one made by me. ðŸ¦„

This project started out as a "let's learn React by re-working something I've already made!", which within a few days turned into "maybe getting comfortable with React would be easier on a project I haven't already spent tons of time thinking about."

Seems like a better way forward, at least for me! So, I hope you enjoy using this silly little app that you've seen a thousand times. ðŸ˜‰

Notes about React and other development projects can be found in [this](link to react-nichelicorn-dev) repo.

## Development Notes
* This project could use a little more work ðŸš§
  - Add *pop* animation when an idea is deleted
  - Add localStorage so ideas can persist across sessions

### Resources
No developer makes anything alone. I'm grateful to have the work of these developers to help make this project!
