# Welcome to IdeaBox!

This is a project that every developer has built, and so here is the one made by me. ðŸ¦„

This project started out as a "let's learn React by re-working something I've already made!", which within a few days turned into "maybe getting comfortable with React would be easier on a project I haven't already spent tons of time thinking about."

Seems like a better way forward, at least for me! So, I hope you enjoy using this silly little app that you've seen a thousand times. ðŸ˜‰
